# Assets

Repository media assets are organized as:

- `assets/branding/`: logos, poster art, and side-banner artwork used by the UI shell and README.
- `assets/screenshots/`: product screenshots used in public documentation.

Do not store runtime state, logs, or generated bundles in this directory.
