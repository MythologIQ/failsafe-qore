## Current Direction

Zo-native design is `implemented` for repository-local scope.
Zo-native implementation layers (MCP proxy, SSH fallback) are `implemented` baseline in this repository.
Zo HTTP API governance layer is `implemented` baseline in this repository.
Release-gate and handoff phases (6-9) are `implemented` for local repository scope.
